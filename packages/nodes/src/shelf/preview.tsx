/**
 * Translucent preview of a shelf — used by the placement tool's cursor
 * and the registry mover. Defers to `buildShelfGeometry` so the preview
 * shape stays in lockstep with whatever the actual shelf will render,
 * then walks the result, **clones** each mesh's material, and mutates
 * the clone for a translucent ghost.
 *
 * Cloning is non-negotiable: `getShelfMaterial` caches the default
 * `MeshStandardMaterial` instance in a module-scoped map keyed on
 * `material` / `materialPreset`, so every unpainted shelf in the scene
 * shares the same material. Mutating `mat.transparent = true` here
 * would leak into every committed shelf and render them all see-through.
 *
 * Building the full geometry tree per-frame would be wasteful, so we
 * memoize the group + dispose the per-mesh material clones on unmount.
 * Geometry is intentionally NOT disposed — `buildShelfGeometry` creates
 * fresh BufferGeometry per call, but if a future revision returns
 * cached geometry, disposing here would corrupt later renders. Keep the
 * cleanup focused on what the preview itself created (the clones).
 *
 * **Raycast is disabled** on every preview mesh: the cursor follows the
 * shelf, so without this the preview itself would intercept the cursor
 * ray, `grid:move` would stop firing as soon as the preview entered the
 * cursor cone, and the placement tool would lose track of the cursor's
 * grid position. Disabling raycast lets the ray pass through the ghost
 * to the grid plane below.
