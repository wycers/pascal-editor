/**
 * Built-in plugin bundling every node kind shipped with the Pascal editor.
 *
 * Apps load this once at bootstrap (`loadPlugin(builtinPlugin)`) before
 * mounting the viewer. New built-in nodes are added by creating a folder
 * here under `src/<kind>/` and appending its `NodeDefinition` below.
 *
 * External plugins follow the exact same shape — same `Plugin` type, same
 * `loadPlugin` call path. This is intentional: the API is stress-tested
 * by built-ins before any third-party plugin lands.
 *
 * All kinds are registered unconditionally. Parity is verified by
 * comparing against deployed production rather than an in-app env-var
 * flag toggle. As of Phase 6 the legacy mount points in `viewer/` are
 * gone — every kind dispatches through the registry.
