# Architecture

Canonical rules for code that touches `packages/core`, `packages/viewer`, `packages/editor`, `packages/mcp`, or `apps/editor`. Read on demand from `AGENTS.md` and from `.agents/skills/review-architecture/SKILL.md`.

## Reading order for an architecture review

1. [layers](layers.md), [systems](systems.md), [renderers](renderers.md), [tools](tools.md), [viewer-isolation](viewer-isolation.md) — required every review.
2. The remaining pages on demand, based on what the diff touches.
